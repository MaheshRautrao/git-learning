// when you are working on with other collaborators on github repo
// one of your team-mate has pushed up the changes to master branch but my
// local repo dont know about them
// how to get those changes
// here we can use git pull and git fetch command
// these two have some differences

// fetching allows us to download changes from remote repo
// but those changes will not be automatically integrated to our working files
// it just lets you see what others have been working in without merging those changes
// into your local repo
// just think it as link
// its like go and get latest info from github but dont add it my working directory
// **** git fetch <remote-url-name>
